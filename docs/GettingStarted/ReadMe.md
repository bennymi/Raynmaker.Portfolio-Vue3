# Getting started

To install the application just download latest release and start "RaynMaker.Portfolio.Shell.exe" passing your custom "Portfoli.json" as first parameter.

An initial "Portfolio.json" you can find [here](../Samples/Portfolio.json).

Your portfolio content you need to specify as "transactions" in an excel sheet. The format 
you can find [here](../Samples/Events.xlsx).

## Limitations

The calculation of your portfolio's performance is still rather "naive" and needs to be improved.

The comparision with some benchmark (e.g. ETF) is still rather basic.
